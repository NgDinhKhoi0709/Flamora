## Style Guidelines:

- The primary color is a refined, muted golden beige (#BAA35E), chosen to evoke warmth and natural elegance, aligning with the brand's 'softer light' concept.
- The background color is a subtle, creamy off-white (#F5F4F0), providing extensive 'white space' and a sense of minimalism, harmonizing with the natural, 'hoa khô' aesthetic.
- The accent color is a rich, warm terracotta brown (#AC5639), providing a grounding contrast and enhancing key interactive elements while maintaining the overall warm and natural palette.
- Headline font: 'Playfair Display' (serif), chosen for its elegant and sophisticated character to headline sections and titles. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body font: 'Be Vietnam Pro' (sans-serif), providing clear readability and a modern, minimalist feel for all general text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Minimalist, line-art icons should be used to maintain a clean and sophisticated aesthetic. Icons should subtly convey their meaning without visual clutter.
- The layout prioritizes ample whitespace and a grid-based structure to emphasize a sense of calm, elegance, and easy navigation. Product cards will be clean and spacious.
- Subtle and smooth transitions, such as fades and gentle slides, for UI interactions (e.g., product image changes, category filtering, cart updates) to enhance the 'tinh tế' feel without being distracting.
